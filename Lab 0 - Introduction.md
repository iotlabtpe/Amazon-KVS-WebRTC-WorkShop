# Lab 0 - Introduction

## Introduction

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (KVS) provides a standards-compliant WebRTC implementation as a fully managed capability. You can use Amazon Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC to securely live stream media or perform two-way audio or video interaction between any camera IoT device and WebRTC-compliant mobile or web players. The WebRTC specification includes a set of IETF protocols including Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), Traversal Using Relay around NAT (TURN) and Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) for establishing peer-to-peer connectivity, in addition tp protocol specifications for reliable and secure real-time media and data streaming.

With this workshop, you will learn the basic concepts of Amazon KVS WebRTC. Moreover, you will learn how to build an Amazon KVS WebRTC C SDK on Raspberry Pi 4 platform with Raspberry Pi Camera.
